# Kodi/XBMC Callback Daemon
A small Go daemon that reads notifications from Kodi/XBMC via the JSON-RPC socket, and performs actions based on those notifications.

I wrote this primarily because the Python callback interface can get blocked very easily by any add-on, which results in heavy delays getting callbacks executed (for example, using the [service.xbmc.callbacks](https://github.com/pilluli/service.xbmc.callbacks) plugin), whereas notifications are shipped over the JSON interface immediately.

This is not an issue with `service.xbmc.callbacks` (good work `pilluli`!), but with the Kodi add-on infrastructure, and with other individual add-ons.

This daemon also aims to provide more flexibility. The targeted backends are [hyperion](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion), `kodi`, `lifx` and `shell`.

## Upgrading to v1.0.0
Due to the name change to keep in line with XBMC's new name Kodi, if you have the previous package installed as `xbmc-callback-daemon`, you should uninstall it before installing the new `kodi-callback-daemon`.  The init scripts should handle your existing `/etc/xbmc-callback-daemon.json` config file, but you're encouraged to move this to the new location `/etc/kodi-callback-daemon.json` as this feature may go away in future to avoid confusion.

## Backends
### Hyperion
The Hyperion backend submits callbacks via the JSON interface. This interface is also used by the `hyperion-remote` command-line utility. There's no end-user documentation for this interface, so when writing callbacks, your best bet is to simply read the [JSON schemas](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/tree/master/libsrc/jsonserver/schema) in the source tree.

### Kodi
The Kodi backend submits callbacks via the JSON-RPC interface. There is excellent documentation available in the [Kodi wiki](http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API).

### LIFX
The LIFX backend submits callbacks via the LIFX LAN protocol.  Callbacks are written in a local format, detailed below

### Shell
The shell backend simply executes a command on the system with specified arguments.

### Boblight
The daemon can act as a boblight proxy, which allows sampling of boblight data to drive lifx lights.  This is a not a typical backend as it does not allow executing any callbacks, but is listed here as it is initialized in the same way as other backends, further documentation on this is provided below.

## Installation
Grab the [Latest Release](https://github.com/pdf/kodi-callback-daemon/releases/latest) as a compiled binary and either install it using your package manager (Debian/Ubuntu/derivs, via the `.deb` package), or extract `kodi-callback-daemon` to somewhere on your path (eg - `/usr/local/bin`) on Linux/OSX/FreeBSD, or where ever on Windows.

Alternatively, you may clone this repository and build it yourself.

## Usage

_NB: I've not actually tested Windows/OSX/FreeBSD support at all, feel free to submit bug reports_

### Configure Kodi/XBMC
You must configure Kodi to accept remote control request, by enabling the options:

- `Allow programs on this system to control Kodi`
- `Allow programs on other systems to control Kodi`

In Kodi settings at `System Settings` -> `Network` -> `Remote Control`

### Run manually
Linux/OSX/FreeBSD:

```bash
/path/to/bin/kodi-callback-daemon /path/to/configFile.json
```

Windows:

```
C:\Path\To\kodi-callback-daemon.exe C:\Path\To\configFile.json
```

### Debian/Ubuntu/derivs
The deb packages include SysV and Upstart init scripts and a systemd unit - enable and use them in the standard fashion.  You will need to add your configuration file at:

```
/etc/kodi-callback-daemon.json
```

Alternatively, you may edit `/etc/default/kodi-callback-daemon` and set the path to your configuration file there.

### Other Linux distributions
You can find the SysV init script at [kodi-callback-daemon.init](https://github.com/pdf/kodi-callback-daemon/blob/master/debian/kodi-callback-daemon.init), and the systemd unit at [kodi-callback-daemon.service](https://github.com/pdf/kodi-callback-daemon/blob/master/debian/kodi-callback-daemon.service).  Place the SysV script in `/etc/init.d/`, or the systemd unit at `/etc/systemd/system/`, and enable/start the service as you normally would.

### Kodi autoexec.py
You might alternatively start the daemon from Kodi's `autostart.py`.  Simply edit `userdata/autoexec.py` in your Kodi directory (ie `~/.kodi/userdata/autoexec.py` on \*nix systems), and add the following:

Linux/OSX/FreeBSD:

```python
import kodi
import subprocess

subprocess.Popen(['/path/to/bin/kodi-callback-daemon', '/path/to/configFile.json'])
```

Windows:

```python
import kodi
import subprocess

subprocess.Popen(['C:\\Path\\To\\kodi-callback-daemon.exe', 'C:\\Path\\To\\configFile.json'])
```

Note the double-slashes necessary for escaping the Windows paths in Python strings.

_Note: If you're using this method, you'll also want to make sure that the daemon is killed on Kodi exit or startup, otherwise you'll get multiple copies running and they'll fight for resources.  I'm not a Python guy, so I'm open to suggestions on how to best handle this._

## User support
If you have questions on how to use the daemon, you may post them in the [Kodi forum thread](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=194910).

## Configuration
The configuration file is written in JSON (I know, JSON is awful for configuration, but since we're passing JSON messages everywhere, it makes the most sense here), and has the following top-level members:

- `kodi` __object__ defines the Kodi connection parameters (_required_)
- `hyperion` __object__ defines the hyperion connection parameters (_optional_, but _required_ if you're using the Hyperion backend)
- `lifx` __object__ defines the lifx connection parameters (_optional_, but _required_ if you're using the LIFX backend)
- `debug` __boolean__ enables debug logging (_optional_)
- `callbacks` __object__ (_required_, or nothing will be done!).

See the [config.example.json](https://github.com/pdf/kodi-callback-daemon/tree/master/contrib/config.example.json) for my Hyperion/LIFX setup, which uses most of the available features.

### Kodi/XBMC Connection
Specify your Kodi/XBMC IP address and port for the JSON interface in the `kodi` property:

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  }
}
```

### Hyperion Connection
If you're using the Hyperion backend, specify your Hyperion address and port for the JSON interface in the `hyperion` property:

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "hyperion": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 19444
  }
}
```

### LIFX Connection
If you're using the LIFX backend, you just need to declare it as an object.

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "lifx": {}
}
```
You can optionally include a timeout for operations, if you're finding it unreliable (LIFX lights can sometimes be slow).  The timeout is a string with the format `<number><unit>`, ie, for `5 seconds`:
```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "lifx": {
    "timeout": "5s"
  }
}
```

### Boblight Connection
If you're using the Boblight proxy, you must declare both the input (listen) and output (hyperion/boblightd) sockets. You can either configure the input to use the standard boblight port (19333), and configure the output and your boblight daemon (hyperion/boblightd) to use an alternative port (19332 in the example below), or do the opposite and have the boblight client connect to a different port.

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "boblight": {
    "input": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 19333
    },
    "output": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 19332
    }
  }
}
```

### Debug logging
You can enable debug logging by setting the debug property to `true`:

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "hyperion": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 19444
  },
  "lifx": {},
  "debug": true
}
```

### Callbacks
The callbacks object is keyed by the Kodi notification method, with each method containing an array of callback objects. There is one exception, which is the `Startup` method - any callbacks attached to this method will be executed when the daemon starts up. Each callback in the array will be executed sequentially. The callback must contain a `backend` property, the value of which is one of `["hyperion", "kodi", "lifx", "shell"]`. All other properties are backend-specific.

#### Kodi
Callbacks using the `kodi` backend contain the `backend` property, a `method` string property containing the Kodi RPC method to call, and a `params` object property containing the parameters to for the RPC call. An example might look like:

```json
{
  "backend": "kodi",
  "method": "GUI.ShowNotification",
  "params": {
    "title": "Callback Daemon",
    "message": "Hello from the callback daemon!",
    "displaytime": 15000
  }
}
```

Full example, mixing `hyperion`, `kodi` and `shell` callbacks:

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "hyperion": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 19444
  },
  "callbacks": {
    "Startup": [
      {
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "effect",
        "priority": 86,
        "effect": {
          "name": "Rainbow swirl"
        }
      },
      {
        "backend": "shell",
        "background": true,
        "command": "/bin/echo",
        "arguments": [
          "-e",
          "The 'arguments' property is optional\n"
        ]
      },
      {
        "backend": "kodi",
        "method": "GUI.ShowNotification",
        "params": {
          "title": "Callback Daemon",
          "message": "Hello from the callback daemon!",
          "displaytime": 15000
        }
      }
    ],
    "Player.OnStop": [
      {
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "effect",
        "priority": 86,
        "effect": {
          "name": "Rainbow swirl"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For details on the available RPC methods, see the [Kodi wiki page](http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API/v6).  Unfortunately, because the Kodi JSON-RPC implementation is non-conformant, you will get errors logged when using RPC methods that return strings instead of conformant JSON-RPC objects, but the calls will execute fine.

#### Hyperion
Callbacks using the `hyperion` backend contain the `backend` property, and all other properties are sent verbatim as the request to Hyperion.  For example, to execute the `Rainbow swirl` effect, the callback would look something like this:

```json
{
  "backend": "hyperion",
  "command": "effect",
  "effect": {
    "name": "Rainbow swirl"
  }
}
```

(see the [Hyperion JSON schemas](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/tree/master/libsrc/jsonserver/schema) for details on the required fields).

And if we wanted to run this callback on `Startup`, and on `Player.OnStop` notifications, our full configuration might look like this:

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "hyperion": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 19444
  },
  "callbacks": {
    "Startup": [
      {
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "effect",
        "priority": 86,
        "effect": {
          "name": "Rainbow swirl"
        }
      }
    ],
    "Player.OnStop": [
      {
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "effect",
        "priority": 86,
        "effect": {
          "name": "Rainbow swirl"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### LIFX
Callbacks using the `lifx` backend contain the `backend` property, a combination of the following properties:

Property | Value | Example | Comment
---------|-------|---------|--------
`power` | `true` or `false` | `"power": true` | A value of `true` sets the power for the listed lights to on, `false` to off.
`powerDuration` | time string `<number><unit>` | `"powerDuration": 5s` | Defines the duration of the power transition, this will fade your lights on or off over the specified duration (example is 5 seconds).  Only valid if combined with `power`.
`color` | color object (HSBK) | `"color": {"hue": 0, "brightness": 65535, "saturation": 65535, kelvin: 2500}` | The color object must contain all of the `hue`, `brightness`, `saturation` and `kelvin` properties to be valid.  The range of valid values is 0-65535 for `hue`, `saturation` and `brightness`, and 2500-9000 for `kelvin`.  The `kelvin` value sets the warmth of white light in degrees, and only applies when `saturation` is near zero.
`colorDuration` | time string `<number><unit>` | `"powerDuration": 5s` | Defines the duration of the color transition, this will fade your lights between colors over the specified duration (example is 5 seconds).  Only valid if combined with `color`.
`boblight` | boblight object | `"boblight": {"lights": [5, 6, 7, 8], "rateLimit": "40ms"}` | The boblight object must contain an array of light IDs `lights` (as configured in your boblight daemon) from which an average color will be calculated, and may optionally specify a `rateLimit` of the format `<number><unit>`, which allows you to reduce the rate at which lights are updated and defaults to the minimum value of `20ms`.
`lights` | array of light labels | `"lights": ["Lounge1", "Lounge2"]` | Defines the list of lights that the callback will apply to, by their labels.
`groups` | array of group labels | `"groups": ["Cinema", "Kitchen"]` | Defines the list of groups that the callback will apply to, by their labels.

```json
{
  "backend": "lifx",
  "power": true,
  "powerDuration": "5s",
  "color": {
    "hue": 65535,
    "brightness": 65535,
    "saturation": 65535,
    "kelvin": 2500
  },
  "colorDuration": "5s",
  "lights": [
    "Lounge1",
    "Lounge2"
  ],
  "groups": [
    "Cinema"
  ]
}
```

And if we wanted to run a callback on `Player.OnPlay`, and on `Player.OnStop` notifications, our full configuration might look like this:

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "lifx": {},
  "callbacks": {
    "Player.OnPlay": [
      {
        "backend": "lifx",
        "power": false,
        "powerDuration": "2s",
        "color": {
          "hue": 0,
          "brightness": 0,
          "saturation": 65535,
          "kelvin": 3000
        },
        "colorDuration": "2s",
        "groups": [
          "Cinema"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Player.OnStop": [
      {
        "backend": "lifx",
        "power": true,
        "powerDuration": "2s",
        "color": {
          "hue": 0,
          "brightness": 65535,
          "saturation": 0,
          "kelvin": 3000
        },
        "colorDuration": "2s",
        "groups": [
          "Cinema"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Using the boblight proxy to update LIFX lights dynamically might look like this, if we wanted to take samples from lights on each side of our boblight output, and send the average of those boblights to two separate LIFX lights, with a moderately sedate update interval of 200ms:


```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "lifx": {},
  "boblight": {
    "input": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 19333
    },
    "output": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 19332
    }
  },
  "callbacks": {
    "Player.OnPlay": [
      {
        "backend": "lifx",
        "power": true,
        "powerDuration": "2s",
        "boblight": {
          "lights": [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15],
          "rateLimit": "200ms"
        },
        "lights": [
          "LeftLight"
        ]
      },
      {
        "backend": "lifx",
        "power": true,
        "powerDuration": "2s",
        "boblight": {
          "lights": [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42],
          "rateLimit": "200ms"
        },
        "lights": [
          "LeftLight"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Shell
Callbacks using the `shell` backend contain the `backend` property, a `command` string property containing the path to the executable to be run, an optional `arguments` array containing a list of arguments to be passed to the command, and an optional `background` property to allow forking a long-running process without waiting for it to return.  An example might look like:

```json
{
  "backend": "shell",
  "background": true,
  "command": "/bin/echo",
  "arguments": [
    "-e",
    "The 'arguments' property is optional\n"
  ]
}
```

Full example, mixing `hyperion` and `shell` callbacks:

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "hyperion": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 19444
  },
  "callbacks": {
    "Startup": [
      {
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "effect",
        "priority": 86,
        "effect": {
          "name": "Rainbow swirl"
        }
      },
      {
        "backend": "shell",
        "background": true,
        "command": "/bin/echo",
        "arguments": [
          "-e",
          "The 'arguments' property is optional\n"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Player.OnStop": [
      {
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "effect",
        "priority": 86,
        "effect": {
          "name": "Rainbow swirl"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Player.OnPlay, Player.OnPause, Player.OnStop
The `Player.OnPlay`, `Player.OnPause` and `Player.OnStop` notifications have one additional, optional property available to callbacks: `types`. This property may contain an array of item types sent with Kodi notifications for this method. At the time of writing, these types are `["movie", "episode", "song"]`.  Callbacks with a `types` property will only execute if the played media type matches one of the listed types in the callback.  Callbacks with no `types` property are always executed on receiving these notifications.  The following example increases Hyperion saturation/value, and decreases gamma compensation for music so that visualizations produce punchy lighting effects, and conversely sets much more sedate values for video types.  It also executes a `clear` command on channel 86 when any media is played (`types` is omitted).

```json
{
  "kodi": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 9090
  },
  "hyperion": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 19444
  },
  "debug": true,
  "callbacks": {
    "Player.OnPlay": [
      {
        "types": ["movie", "episode"],
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "transform",
        "transform": {
          "gamma": [2.2, 2.2, 2.8],
          "valueGain": 1.0,
          "saturationGain": 1.0
        }
      },
      {
        "types": ["song"],
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "transform",
        "transform": {
          "gamma": [0.8, 0.8, 0.8],
          "valueGain": 2.0,
          "saturationGain": 2.0
        }
      },
      {
        "backend": "hyperion",
        "command": "clear",
        "priority": 86
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
